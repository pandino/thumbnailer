# DISABLE_DELETION Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a new configuration flag `DISABLE_DELETION` to prevent the deletion worker from running. This flag is configurable via environment variables and affects all deletion-related operations in the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration (`internal/config/config.go`)
- Added `DisableDeletion bool` field to the Config struct
- Added environment variable support: `DISABLE_DELETION` (default: `false`)
- Uses `getEnvAsBool()` helper function for parsing

### 2. Worker (`internal/worker/worker.go`)
- Modified scheduled cleanup to skip when `DisableDeletion` is true
- Modified `PerformCleanup()` to return error when deletion is disabled

### 3. Server Handlers (`internal/server/handlers.go`)
- Added checks in `handleCleanup()` to return HTTP 403 when deletion is disabled
- Added checks in `handleProcessDeletions()` to return HTTP 403 when deletion is disabled

### 4. Scanner (`internal/scanner/scanner.go`)
- Modified `CleanupOrphans()` to skip `processDeletedItems()` when deletion is disabled
- Other cleanup operations (orphaned database entries, orphaned thumbnails) continue to work

### 5. Documentation (`README.md`)
- Added `DISABLE_DELETION` to the environment variables section

## Behavior When Enabled

When `DISABLE_DELETION=true`:
- Scheduled cleanup tasks skip deletion processing
- Manual cleanup requests via web interface return HTTP 403 Forbidden
- Manual cleanup requests via worker API return an error
- The `processDeletedItems()` function is skipped during cleanup operations
- Regular cleanup operations (orphaned database entries, orphaned thumbnails) continue to work

## Environment Variable Usage

```bash
# Disable deletion processing
export DISABLE_DELETION=true

# Enable deletion processing (default)
export DISABLE_DELETION=false
```

## Testing
- Added test script to verify configuration loading
- Verified all packages build successfully
- Tested with both true/false values and invalid values
